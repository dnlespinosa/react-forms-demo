Goals 
    Build forms with react 
    Understand what controlled components are 

One Source of Truth 
    We make the react state by the single source of Truth
    React controls 
        what is shown 
        What happens the user types 
    Input elements controlled in this way are called controlled components 

How The controlled form works 
    Since value attribute is set on the element, displayed value will always be that 
    Since handlechange runs on every keystrong, the displayed value will update as the user types
